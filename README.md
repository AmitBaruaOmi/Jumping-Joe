### PROJECT | JUMPING JOE


## Introduction

I have made a 2D game using the knowledge I have gained so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this exercise, I have created **"A Parkour Figure (JOE) jumping on the obstacles"** game using DOM manipulation, classes, and object-oriented programming (OOP).


## Mission

Player needs to avoid the obstacles either jumping or skipping from the side.

Colliding three times will end the game.

Lives: 03


## Bugs

Game structure dvelopement work in porogress.

Bugs can be seen.


# Common bugs:
Road going opposite direction.

Player is not able to jump perfectly over the 
obstacles.

Margin of the player is a bit widen which makes the player to collide with the obstacle even though the obstacle is far away.
